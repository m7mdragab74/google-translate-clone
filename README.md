Google Translate Clone App
In this project, I created a Google Translate Clone App using Flutter to replicate the core functionality of Google Translate with a modern and responsive design. The app supports language translation with real-time data fetching from APIs and features a user-friendly interface with seamless navigation.

Key Features:
Dio Package for handling HTTP requests to fetch language data and translation results.
MVVM Architecture for clean and maintainable code structure.
Cubit for efficient state management, ensuring smooth user experience and data flow.
Responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on mobile devices.
A Custom AppBar and Language Selection View with search functionality for easy access to available languages.
This project allowed me to practice and implement advanced Flutter techniques and state management while creating a useful, real-world application. The app combines translation capabilities with a weather feature, making it both functional and engaging.
